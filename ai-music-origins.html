            <h2>The Origins of AI Music Technology</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            <p>Modern AI music technology is currently empowering independent artists, but the journey began much earlier than many realize[cite: 1]. Artificial intelligence has actually been incorporated into music since 1957[cite: 2].</p>

            <p>In those early years, the first accounts of AI in music were performed on massive supercomputers[cite: 3]. Because of the extreme capital required to afford and operate these machines, the technology was only accessible to big corporations rather than common people[cite: 3]. Today, that barrier has been broken, moving the power from the boardroom to the bedroom studio.</p>

            <h2>Modern AI Music Technology Empowers Independent Artists</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            <p>Modern AI music technology empowers independent artists[cite: 1]. Artificial intelligence has been incorporated in music since 1957, though early accounts were restricted to those with the capital to afford supercomputers[cite: 2, 3]. Today, the technology is accessible to common people rather than just big corporations[cite: 3].</p>

            <p>AI in music technology is the use of artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning to assist in or automate the creation, production, and consumption of music[cite: 5]. What previously took years of music theory can now be achieved with a plugin in a digital audio workstation[cite: 6].</p>

            <h3>AI Tools and Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Tools like <a href="https://www.landr.com/">LANDR</a>, launched in 2014, provide mastering services that use EQ adjustments to reach industry standards[cite: 8, 9]. This previously required an audio engineer with years of experience[cite: 9]. Other similar services include <a href="https://emastered.com/">eMastered</a>, <a href="https://www.bandlab.com/mastering">BandLab Mastering</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudbounce.com/">CloudBounce</a>, <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/ozone.html">iZotope Ozone</a>, and <a href="https://www.kits.ai/">Kits.ai</a>[cite: 12].</p>

            <h3>Generative AI and Industry Impact</h3>
            <p><a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> and <a href="https://www.udio.com/">Udio</a> are generative platforms that can create full radio-quality songs with vocals[cite: 16, 17]. This technology has disrupted major labels like Sony, Universal, and Warner Music Group, leading to legal action in 2024 over copyrighted training data[cite: 18, 19].</p>

            <p>AI artists are already accumulating millions of monthly listeners[cite: 24]. Artists like The Velvet Sundown, Breaking Rust, Cain Walker, and Xania Monet have surpassed 10 million listeners[cite: 25]. These figures are developed through machine learning, voice cloning, and neural networks[cite: 27, 28].</p>

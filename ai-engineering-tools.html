            <p>AI in music technology is defined as using algorithms and machine learning to assist or automate the creation, production, and consumption of music[cite: 5]. Tasks that once required years of music theory can now be achieved with a simple plugin in a digital audio workstation (DAW)[cite: 6].</p>

            <p>One of the pioneers, LANDR, launched in 2014 to provide automated mastering services[cite: 8]. This process uses EQ adjustments to make songs meet industry standards—a task that previously required an audio engineer with a trained ear and years of experience[cite: 9].</p>

            <p>Today, many tools provide similar services, including[cite: 12]:
                <ul>
                    <li>eMastered [cite: 12]</li>
                    <li>BandLab Mastering [cite: 12]</li>
                    <li>CloudBounce [cite: 12]</li>
                    <li>iZotope Ozone [cite: 12]</li>
                    <li>Kits.ai [cite: 12]</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>These services are often subscription-based and can be used as web-based tools or direct DAW plugins[cite: 13, 14].</p>

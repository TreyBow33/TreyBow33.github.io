        <h2>About This Newsletter</h2>
        <p>This newsletter covers the rapidly evolving world of <strong>AI Audio & Music</strong>[cite: 5]. We explore how artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning are being used to assist in or automate the creation, production, and consumption of music[cite: 5].</p>
        
        <p>I chose this focus area because AI has shifted the power dynamic in the music industry[cite: 1, 3]. What once required massive supercomputers or expensive professional studios is now achievable for the common creator using simple plugins and generative platforms[cite: 3, 6, 17].</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Ronald Bowman</strong>. I am a college student currently exploring the fundamentals of IT, cloud computing, and applied AI.</p>
        
        <p>I have a deep interest in the intersection of technical infrastructure and creative arts[cite: 15, 27]. I am particularly fascinated by how complex systems like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and neural networks are used to develop AI artists that can reach millions of listeners[cite: 24, 27, 29].</p>

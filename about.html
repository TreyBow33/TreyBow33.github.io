        <h2>About This Newsletter</h2>
        <p>This newsletter focuses on <strong>AI Audio & Music</strong>, exploring how generative AI and machine learning are changing the way we create and consume sound.</p>
        <p>I chose this topic because I am fascinated by the intersection of software development concepts—like infrastructure and automation—and the creative process of audio engineering.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a student currently exploring the technical and strategic aspects of cloud computing and applied AI. Outside of my technical studies, I have a deep interest in music production and the evolution of hip-hop culture.</p>

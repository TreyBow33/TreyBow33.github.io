            <h2>Modern AI Music Technology Empowers Independent Artists</h2>
            <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

            [cite_start]<p>Modern AI music technology empowers independent artists[cite: 1]. [cite_start]While AI has been in music since 1957, it was once limited to those with the capital for supercomputers[cite: 2, 3]. [cite_start]Today, these algorithms assist in or automate the creation, production, and consumption of music for everyone[cite: 5].</p>

            [cite_start]<p>What once required years of music theory is now achievable with a plugin[cite: 6]. [cite_start]Tools like <a href="https://www.landr.com/">LANDR</a>, <a href="https://emastered.com/">eMastered</a>, <a href="https://www.bandlab.com/mastering">BandLab Mastering</a>, and <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/ozone.html">iZotope Ozone</a> allow creators to accomplish engineering tasks in fractions of the time[cite: 8, 11, 12].</p>

            [cite_start]<p>Generative platforms like <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> and <a href="https://www.udio.com/">Udio</a> can create full radio-quality songs with vocals[cite: 16, 17]. [cite_start]This has caused disruption among major labels like Sony and Universal, leading to legal actions in 2024 over copyrighted training data[cite: 18, 19].</p>

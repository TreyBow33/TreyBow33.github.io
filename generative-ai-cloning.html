            <h2>Generative AI: The Rise of the AI Artist</h2>
            <p class="date">January 23, 2026</p>

            <p>Suno and Udio have emerged as top-tier generative AI platforms capable of creating full, radio-quality songs with vocals from start to finish[cite: 16, 17]. This technology has disturbed major labels like Sony, Universal, and Warner Music Group, who took legal action in 2024 for alleged copyright infringement in training these models[cite: 18, 19].</p>

            <p>Beyond creation tools, we are seeing the rise of actual AI artists[cite: 23]. Performers like The Velvet Sundown, Breaking Rust, Cain Walker, and Xania Monet have already surpassed 10 million monthly listeners[cite: 25].</p>

            <p>These artists are developed through machine learning, deep learning, and voice cloning[cite: 27, 28]. By using General Adversarial Networks (GANs), the AI analyzes existing patterns to make the music feel real compared to existing music databases[cite: 29].</p>
